What is Cryptojacking?
Cryptojacking is the unauthorized use of someone else’s computer to mine cryptocurrency. Hackers do this by either getting the victim to click on a malicious link through an email that loads cryptomining code on the
computer or by infecting a website with JavaScript code that auto -executes once loaded in the victim’s browser.
Either way, the cryptomining code then runs in the background as unsuspecting victims use their computers normally.</description>
