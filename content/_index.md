# Welcome to Null Chapter 

Null chapter is a local chapter at VIT-AP. We are a group of skilled hackers, developers, and tech enthusiasts who engage in various projects and Web Hunts. We aim to push technology better by finding out bugs and conduct workshops, conferences, events, and completions of both technical and non-technical.

Here, everyone is given an equal opportunity to showcase their skills and talents in the field of cybersecurity. Null creates different opportunities for students to learn interesting stuff and at the same time the students gain awareness about all kinds of cyber threats and online safety which is currently one of the most important things to learn in this digital world.

>New forums and communities that exist on the surface, deep and dark web have granted easy access for individuals to trade data and information often undetected until it’s too late.

Human Reconnaissance is a unique service that profiles an individual’s digital footprint using open source,
deep web intelligence to identify online behavioural traits that could be a threat to your organization.

We brought over our beloved Dr Sibi Chakkaravarthy Sethuraman (Associate Professor, VIT-AP) to help us better understand this issue.
