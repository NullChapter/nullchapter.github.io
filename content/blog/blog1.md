**Follow these simple steps to identify which company is selling your mail ID to spammers!**

- Whenever you are registering yourself on any website you will receive a prompt to enter your email. While entering your mail id, do this simple hack:

- Add "+" to your mail followed by the website name.
- Example: if your email id is admin@gmail.com you can register with admin+WebSiteName@gmail.com or admin+facebook@gmail.com

- Whatever you enter after the "+" symbol onwards will be ignored and still they can reach our inbox

- Main Trick: Whenever you receive a spam email just check your email extension(admin+"extension"@gmail.com) then you'll get to know which company sold your mail.

>Information security is your minimum responsibility!
